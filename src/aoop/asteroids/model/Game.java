/**
 *	The game class is the backbone of all simulations of the asteroid game. It 
 *	contains all game object and keeps track of some other required variables 
 *	in order to specify game rules.
 *	<p>
 *	The game rules are as follows:
 *	<ul>
 *		<li> All game objects are updated according to their own rules every 
 *			game tick. </li>
 *		<li> Every 200th game tick a new asteroid is spawn. An asteroid cannot 
 *			spawn within a 50 pixel radius of the player. </li>
 *		<li> There is a maximum amount of asteroids that are allowed to be 
 *			active simultaneously. Asteroids that spawn from destroying a 
 *			larger asteroid do count towards this maximum, but are allowed to 
 *			spawn if maximum is exceeded. </li>
 *		<li> Destroying an asteroid spawns two smaller asteroids. I.e. large 
 *			asteroids spawn two medium asteroids and medium asteroids spawn two 
 *			small asteroids upon destruction. </li>
 *		<li> The player dies upon colliding with either a buller or an 
 *			asteroid. </li>
 *		<li> Destroying every 5th asteroid increases the asteroid limit by 1, 
 *			increasing the difficulty. </li>
 *	</ul>
 *	<p>
 *	This class implements Runnable, so all simulations will be run in its own 
 *	thread. This class extends Observable in order to notify the view element 
 *	of the program, without keeping a reference to those objects.
